To build Safejumper on linux you'll need the following:

Qt 5.7.0 or newer built with -static option. Use the configureqt.sh script if wanted.
Git clone of safejumper sources.

After building Qt make sure it's qmake is in your path and do the following:

cd buildlinux
qmake ../src
make
cp safejumper/safejumper linuxfiles
cp launchopenvpn/launchopenvpn linuxfiles
cp netdown/netdown linuxfiles

Then the content of linuxfiles mostly goes into /opt/safejumper/.
